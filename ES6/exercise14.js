• Suppose the following configuration object of a financial chart is given:
let config = {
chartType : 0,
bullColor : 'green',
bearColor : 'red',
days : 30

• Complete the function signature below such that the function may be called with any config
objects (null and undefined are not allowed as inputs). If any of the four keys are missing,
substitute their default values. The default values are the same as in the example configuration
object.
